# The Rise and Fall of Larceny  
### A Look at Theft Trends in San Francisco

---

## Introduction

San Francisco is a city known for its cultural richness, scenic beauty, and iconic landmarks. Yet like any major urban center, it faces persistent challenges with crime. One of the most prevalent forms of crime in San Francisco has consistently been larceny/theft—a category that includes a wide range of offenses, from pickpocketing to shoplifting to stolen electronics.

This story draws from a comprehensive dataset of police incident reports provided by the **San Francisco Police Department (SFPD)**. The dataset spans over two decades, from **2003 through early 2025**, and includes more than **1.7 million records** of reported crimes across the city. Each record details the type of crime, the time and location it occurred, and its resolution status. For this analysis, we focused specifically on incidents categorized as **larceny/theft**, the most commonly reported crime in the dataset.

The dataset is publicly available and was downloaded from the City of San Francisco's open data portal at [data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?category=Public+Safety&sortBy=relevance&page=1&pageSize=20), which provides access to a variety of government-maintained data for public research and transparency.

Our goal is to understand how the frequency of theft has evolved over time and what those trends reveal about life in San Francisco.

## A Decade of Climbing Crime

From 2010 to 2018, San Francisco saw a dramatic increase in larceny/theft incidents. In 2010, the city recorded around **24,000 cases**. By 2018, that number had more than doubled, peaking at nearly **58,000 incidents**. This surge could be attributed to several factors: a growing population, increased tourism, expanding economic inequality, and resource constraints on law enforcement. The rise in property crime became a growing concern for residents and businesses alike.

This upward trend placed larceny/theft at the center of public conversations about safety, enforcement, and quality of life in the city. In particular, neighborhoods with high foot traffic and commercial activity became hotspots for opportunistic crimes.

## The Sudden Pandemic Plunge

Then came 2020.

As the COVID-19 pandemic shut down cities across the globe, San Francisco saw an immediate and dramatic drop in theft. Reported incidents fell to just over **28,000**, a level not seen since the early 2000s. The explanation is straightforward: with fewer people on the streets, many businesses closed, and most residents staying indoors, the usual opportunities for theft simply disappeared.

This drop is a striking example of how quickly crime patterns can shift in response to external events. It also provided a momentary pause in a long-term upward trend, offering a natural break in the data that highlights the relationship between public activity and crime.

## Climbing Back, But Not All the Way

Following the pandemic's most severe restrictions, larceny/theft began to rebound. In 2021 and 2022, cases climbed again, reaching over **34,000 incidents** by 2023. However, the city has yet to return to its pre-pandemic peak.

Interestingly, preliminary data for 2024 and early 2025 shows a continued decline. While it’s too early to determine whether this drop will continue, it may suggest changes in enforcement, urban movement, or even economic conditions that are dampening theft.

## Why This Matters

Larceny/theft is not just about missing phones or broken car windows—it represents the public’s everyday experience with crime. Trends in theft tell a broader story about how life in a city shifts in response to both internal dynamics and external forces.

By tracking how larceny/theft has risen, fallen, and partially rebounded over time, we gain insights into how a city like San Francisco adapts, struggles, and recovers. This story is a reminder of the power of data to show not just where we are, but where we’ve been—and possibly where we’re headed.

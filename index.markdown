This is my first blog post using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects with you!

## What I've Learned So Far

Setting up a Jekyll site with GitHub Pages has been an interesting journey. Here are some key things I've learned:

1. Git is powerful for version control
2. Jekyll makes it easy to create static websites
3. Ruby and bundle help manage dependencies
4. GitHub Pages provides free hosting for static sites

## Next Steps

In the coming weeks, I plan to:

- Customize the theme and layout
- Add more content and projects
- Implement some interactive features
- Improve the overall design

Stay tuned for more updates!
